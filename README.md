# Credit Risk Modeling for Lauki Finance

Welcome to the **Credit Risk Modeling Project** for Lauki Finance! This repository contains the code and resources for building, deploying, and showcasing a machine learning-based credit risk assessment model. The project is deployed on Streamlit and can be accessed through the following link:

[Live Application on Streamlit](https://kajal-credit-risk-model-ml-project2.streamlit.app)

## Project Overview

Credit risk modeling is an essential component of financial institutions. This project aims to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan using advanced machine learning techniques. The model is designed to assist Lauki Finance in making data-driven lending decisions and mitigating financial risks.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Web Application**: Users can input borrower details and receive real-time predictions on credit risk.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Trained using a robust dataset and fine-tuned with advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Fully deployed and accessible via the Streamlit platform.

## How to Use the Application
1. Visit the [Streamlit Application](https://kajal-credit-risk-model-ml-project2.streamlit.app).
2. Enter the required borrower details in the input fields.
3. Click on the **Predict** button to view the credit risk prediction.
4. Explore the additional insights and model explanations provided in the app.

## Technical Details

### Dataset
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset containing borrower information such as:
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Duration
- Credit History
- Other relevant financial metrics

### Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: The project uses Logistic Regression for explainability of the impact of the cofficients.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance is evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - pandas, numpy (Data Analysis)
  - scikit-learn (Model Development)
  - Streamlit (Web Application)
  - matplotlib, seaborn (Visualization)
